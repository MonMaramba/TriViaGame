#The Objectives

1. This project is a part of my coursework requirements for the UC Berkeley Extension Coding Bootcamp.
It is a fun trivia game focusing on trivia from the animated t.v. show The Simpsons.

1. This is an exercise in working with javascript objects and arrays of objects. The challenge was how to build those objects and access them using javascript and jquery.

1. This homework also required the use of setInterval and setTimeOut functions as a means of timing the execution of code. 

1. Alerts were intentionally avoided as it can be disruptive in terms of the user experience. 

##User Notes

1. This will be deployed and hopefully, it will have some entertainment value. It will be more to highlight what I've learned so far.

1. Please let me know if you have comments on how to make this app better or if you notice some bugs.

1. I would like to learn how to code better and if there's a better way of doing things, please don't hesitate to show me... and kindly explain to me as if I was a 12 year old :)

1. I am not expecting anybody needing help running this eventually but just in case, email monmaramba@yahoo.com.
